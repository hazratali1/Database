• Previous Table:
CREATE TABLE branch (
branch_name varchar(20),
branch_city varchar (20),

);

CREATE TABLE customer_ (
customer_ID int PRIMARY KEY,
customer_name varchar(20),
customer_city int (5)
);

CREATE TABLE account (
acount_number int PRIMARY KEY,

branch_name varchar(20),
blance int (10)
);
CREATE TABLE loan (
loan_number int PRIMARY KEY,
branch_name varchar(20),
ammount int (10)
);
CREATE TABLE depositor (
customer_name varchar(20),
acount_number int (10)PRIMARY KEY,
FOREIGN KEY (acount_number) REFERENCES account (acount_number)
);

CREATE TABLE brrower (

acount_number int (10)PRIMARY KEY,
FOREIGN KEY (acount_number) REFERENCES account (acount_number)

with condition.
SELECT * FROM account
WHERE blance > 100 AND branch_name = 'mirpur';

with comparison operation.
SELECT * FROM account
WHERE blance >= '3000' AND branch_name != 'dhaka';

SELECT * FROM customer_ ORDER BY customer_name ASC;

With Not Between.
